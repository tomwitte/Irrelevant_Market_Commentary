Household Debt Service Payments as a Percent of Disposable Personal Income

Unprecendented increase in the homeownership rate the past few quarters as of December 2020. 
Interesting that debt service payments low compared to historical levels but not
surprising given low interest rate environment. However, the disposable income data is
the aggregrate when at the various margins would be more important to see since all it takes is
for a few percent of a credit portfolio to default for it to blow up. In addition, what the debt
service payments would look like with increases in rates would be good to see. The 
debt service payments data can paint a nice picture when it in reality it could be just showing
a state of unstable equilibrium, something that can be more easily seen when compartmentalizing the data.

XHB(Homebuilder ETF) and XLF(Financials ETF). 
With homebuilders and financials being tethered in similar but often different ways with different degrees to 
real economic activity, making a relative volatility play between these two etfs might be attractive. Can see long-term scenarios
where the traditional banks are replaced through innovation/fintech while the builders and related industries remain, but
many instances where the builders and related industries go bust or contract much sharper than the financials. In the more short to medium
term many cases to where there volatility might be priced similar/different by the market but the realized volatility between the two could
be more different/similair than priced.
